Being an avid hiker, I enjoy working on hiking trail datasets and seeing what insights I can gleam from them. This will be updated over time. 

I used SQL to identify which hiking trails had over 4k elevation in feet using the National Park Website Trails dataset. Dataset source: https://public-nps.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/nps::nps-trails-web-mercator-1/explore?location=13.111458%2C-12.521000%2C2.69
